                <p>The internship is concluded with an exam (internship exam). The exam is internal and assessed according to the 7-point grading scale. <br>

The internship can form the basis of the studentâ€™s final project and can be organised in a flexible and differentiated manner. Students can choose to combine internships in two or more organisations or different types of internships.
<br>
The conditions governing internships are described in more detail on the learning platform for the Multimedia Design and Communication programme before the fourth semester begins. The internship is unpaid. Based on the general learning objectives for the internship period, students develop their own individual learning objectives for their internship in cooperation with the host company and the institution. <br>
During the internship, students are assigned a supervisor from the programme and a contact/supervisor from the host organisation. The internship is concluded with an exam (internship exam).
