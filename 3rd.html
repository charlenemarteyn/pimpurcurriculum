                <h2>Third semester - Compulsory Element Exam - Multimedia Production Advanced</h2>
                <h2>20 ECTS</h2>
                <p>The objective is to test the students’ understanding of the theory, method and tools acquired through the compulsory programme element Multimedia Production Advanced, and the students’ ability to develop a professional profile in relation to the current requirements in the area.
                </p>

                <h2>Exam</h2>
                <p>The exam form may vary depending on the objective of the elective subject in question. The exam is described under each elective subject on the learning platform for the Multimedia Design and Communication programme.
                    <br><br>The exam is assessed by the examiner and an internal co-examiner according to the 7-point grading scale. Students are awarded one grade for their overall performance, covering product(s), presentation and discussion. The performance is assessed on the basis of whether the students have understood the elective subject goals and learning objectives, as described in the electives catalogue, and how they are presented.</p>
                <h3>Re-exam</h3>
                <p>Students who fail the first exam attempt are offered two more attempts. The re-exam is held immediately before or at the beginning of the following semester. The extent of the re-exam is based on an academic assessment of the reason for the need for a reexam. The purpose of the re-exam is the same as for the ordinary exam.
